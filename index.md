The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family.

I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot.

Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?!

I know words. I have the best words. An ‘extremely credible source’ has called my office and told me that Barack Obama’s placeholder text is a fraud. The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! You could see there was text coming out of her eyes, text coming out of her wherever.

I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. If Trump Ipsum weren’t my own words, perhaps I’d be dating it. I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things.
